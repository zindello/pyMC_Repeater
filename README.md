# pyMC_repeater

Repeater Daemon in Python using the `pymc_core` Lib.

---

I started **pyMC_core** as a way to really get under the skin of **MeshCore** — to see how it ticked and why it behaved the way it did.
After a few late nights of tinkering, testing, and head-scratching, I shared what I’d learned with the community.
The response was honestly overwhelming — loads of encouragement, great feedback, and a few people asking if I could spin it into a lightweight **repeater daemon** that would run happily on low-power, Pi-class hardware.

That challenge shaped much of what followed:
- I went with a lightweight HTTP server (**CherryPy**) instead of a full-fat framework.
- I stuck with simple polling over WebSockets — it’s more reliable, has fewer dependencies, and is far less resource hungry.
- I kept the architecture focused on being **clear, modular, and hackable** rather than chasing performance numbers.

There’s still plenty of room for this project to grow and improve — but you’ve got to start somewhere!
My hope is that **pyMC_repeater** serves as a solid, approachable foundation that others can learn from, build on, and maybe even have a bit of fun with along the way.

> **I’d love to see these repeaters out in the wild — actually running in real networks and production setups.**
> My own testing so far has been in a very synthetic environment with little to no other users in my area,
> so feedback from real-world deployments would be incredibly valuable!

## Overview

The repeater daemon runs continuously as a background process, forwarding LoRa packets using `pymc_core`'s Dispatcher and packet routing.

## Installation

Before You Begin

Make sure SPI is switched on using raspi-config:

```bash 
sudo raspi-config
```

1. Go to Interface Options
2. Select SPI
3. Choose Enable
4. Reboot when prompted:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, you can confirm SPI is active:
```bash 
ls /dev/spi*
```

You should see something like:
```bash 
/dev/spidev0.0  /dev/spidev0.1
```

**Install Git (if not already installed):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
```

**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rightup/pyMC_Repeater.git
cd pyMC_Repeater
```

**Quick Install:**
```bash
sudo ./manage.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a dedicated `repeater` service user with hardware access
- Install files to `/opt/pymc_repeater`
- Create configuration directory at `/etc/pymc_repeater`
- Setup log directory at `/var/log/pymc_repeater`
- **Launch interactive radio & hardware configuration wizard**
- Install and enable systemd service

**After Installation:**
```bash
# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u pymc-repeater -f

# Access web dashboard
http://<repeater-ip>:8000
```

**Development Install:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is created and configured during installation at:
```
/etc/pymc_repeater/config.yaml
```

To reconfigure radio and hardware settings after installation, run:
```bash
sudo bash setup-radio-config.sh /etc/pymc_repeater
# or
sudo ./manage.sh
# then restart the service
sudo systemctl restart pymc-repeater

```
## Upgrading

To upgrade an existing installation to the latest version:

```bash
# Navigate to your pyMC_Repeater directory
cd pyMC_Repeater

# Run the upgrade script
sudo ./manage.sh
```

The upgrade script will:
- Pull the latest code from the main branch
- Update all application files
- Upgrade Python dependencies if needed
- Restart the service automatically
- Preserve your existing configuration




## Uninstallation

```bash
sudo ./manage.sh
```

This script will:
- Stop and disable the systemd service
- Remove the installation directory
- Optionally remove configuration, logs, and user data
- Optionally remove the service user account

The script will prompt you for each optional removal step.


## Roadmap / Planned Features

- [ ] **Public Map Integration** - Submit repeater location and details to public map for discovery
- [ ] **Remote Administration over LoRa** - Manage repeater configuration remotely via LoRa mesh
- [ ] **Trace Request Handling** - Respond to trace/diagnostic requests from mesh network


## Contributing

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install in development mode with dev tools (black, pytest, isort, mypy, etc)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Setup pre-commit hooks for code quality
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Manually run pre-commit checks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
