# pyMC_repeater

Repeater Daemon in Python using the `pymc_core` Lib.

---

I started **pyMC_core** as a way to really get under the skin of **MeshCore** — to see how it ticked and why it behaved the way it did.
After a few late nights of tinkering, testing, and head-scratching, I shared what I’d learned with the community.
The response was honestly overwhelming — loads of encouragement, great feedback, and a few people asking if I could spin it into a lightweight **repeater daemon** that would run happily on low-power, Pi-class hardware.

That challenge shaped much of what followed:
- I went with a lightweight HTTP server (**CherryPy**) instead of a full-fat framework.
- I stuck with simple polling over WebSockets — it’s more reliable, has fewer dependencies, and is far less resource hungry.
- I kept the architecture focused on being **clear, modular, and hackable** rather than chasing performance numbers.

There’s still plenty of room for this project to grow and improve — but you’ve got to start somewhere!
My hope is that **pyMC_repeater** serves as a solid, approachable foundation that others can learn from, build on, and maybe even have a bit of fun with along the way.

> **I’d love to see these repeaters out in the wild — actually running in real networks and production setups.**
> My own testing so far has been in a very synthetic environment with little to no other users in my area,
> so feedback from real-world deployments would be incredibly valuable!

## Overview

The repeater daemon runs continuously as a background process, forwarding LoRa packets using `pymc_core`'s Dispatcher and packet routing.

---

## Supported Hardware (Out of the Box)

The repeater supports two radio backends:

- **SX1262 (SPI)** — Direct connection to LoRa modules (HATs, etc.) as listed below.
- **KISS modem** — Serial TNC using the KISS protocol. Set `radio_type: kiss` in config and configure `kiss.port` and `kiss.baud_rate`.

> [!CAUTION]
> ## Compatibility

> ### Supported Radio Interfaces
>
> | Interface | Supported |
> |------------|------------|

> | UART-based HATs | ❌ No |
> | SX1302 concentrator boards | ❌ No |
> | SX1303 concentrator boards | ❌ No |
>
> This project supports **single-radio SPI transceivers only**, either:
> - Connected directly via SPI

## Installation

Before You Begin

Make sure SPI is switched on using raspi-config:

```bash 
sudo raspi-config
```

1. Go to Interface Options
2. Select SPI
3. Choose Enable
4. Reboot when prompted:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, you can confirm SPI is active:
```bash 
ls /dev/spi*
```

You should see something like:
```bash 
/dev/spidev0.0  /dev/spidev0.1
```

**Install Git (if not already installed):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
```

**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rightup/pyMC_Repeater.git
cd pyMC_Repeater
```

**Quick Install:**
```bash
sudo ./manage.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a dedicated `repeater` service user with hardware access
- Install files to `/opt/pymc_repeater`
- Create configuration directory at `/etc/pymc_repeater`
- Setup log directory at `/var/log/pymc_repeater`
- **Launch interactive radio & hardware configuration wizard**
- Install and enable systemd service

**After Installation:**
```bash
# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u pymc-repeater -f

# Access web dashboard
http://<repeater-ip>:8000
```

**Development Install:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is created and configured during installation at:
```
/etc/pymc_repeater/config.yaml
```

To reconfigure radio and hardware settings after installation, run:
```bash
sudo bash setup-radio-config.sh /etc/pymc_repeater
# or
sudo ./manage.sh
# then restart the service
sudo systemctl restart pymc-repeater

```
## Upgrading

To upgrade an existing installation to the latest version:

```bash
# Navigate to your pyMC_Repeater directory
cd pyMC_Repeater

# Run the upgrade script
sudo ./manage.sh
```

The upgrade script will:
- Pull the latest code from the main branch
- Update all application files
- Upgrade Python dependencies if needed
- Restart the service automatically
- Preserve your existing configuration

## Installing on Proxmox (LXC Container)

pyMC Repeater can run inside a Proxmox LXC container using a **CH341 USB-to-SPI adapter** for radio communication. This is ideal for headless, always-on deployments without dedicating a full Raspberry Pi.

### Requirements

- **Proxmox VE 7.x or 8.x** host
- **CH341 USB-to-SPI adapter** (VID `1a86`, PID `5512`) connected to the Proxmox host
- **SX1262-based LoRa module** (e.g. Ebyte E22-900M30S) wired to the CH341 adapter
- Internet connectivity for the container

### One-Line Install

Run this on the **Proxmox host** (not inside a container):

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rightup/pyMC_Repeater/feat/newRadios/scripts/proxmox-install.sh)"
```

> **Tip:** Replace `feat/newRadios` in the URL with whichever branch you want to install.

The installer will interactively prompt you for container settings (hostname, RAM, disk, bridge, etc.) and then:

1. Download a Debian 12 LXC template
2. Create a **privileged** container with USB passthrough
3. Install a host-side udev rule for the CH341 device
4. Clone the repository and pre-seed the config with CH341 GPIO pin mappings
5. Run `manage.sh install` inside the container
6. Display the dashboard URL when finished

### Default Container Settings

| Setting   | Default         |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Hostname  | `pymc-repeater` |
| RAM       | 1024 MB         |
| Disk      | 4 GB            |
| CPU cores | 2               |
| Bridge    | `vmbr0`         |
| Storage   | `local-lvm`     |
| Password  | `pymc`          |

### After Installation

```bash
# Enter the container
pct enter <CTID>

# View service logs
journalctl -u pymc-repeater -f

# Access web dashboard
http://<container-ip>:8000

# Manage the repeater
cd /opt/pymc_repeater && bash manage.sh
```

### CH341 GPIO Pin Mapping

The installer pre-configures the CH341 GPIO pins for an E22 module. These differ from the Raspberry Pi BCM pin numbers:

| Function | CH341 GPIO | Pi BCM (default) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| CS       | 0         | 21                |
| RXEN     | 1         | -1                |
| Reset    | 2         | 18                |
| Busy     | 4         | 20                |
| IRQ      | 6         | 16                |

The installer also enables `use_dio3_tcxo` and `use_dio2_rf` for E22 modules.

### Troubleshooting (Proxmox)

- **USB device not found**: Make sure the CH341 is plugged into the Proxmox host and shows up with `lsusb -d 1a86:5512`
- **Permission denied on USB**: The installer creates a host udev rule (`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch341.rules`). Run `udevadm trigger` on the host if needed
- **Container can't see USB**: Verify USB passthrough lines exist in `/etc/pve/lxc/<CTID>.conf`:
  ```
  lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 189:* rwm
  lxc.mount.entry: /dev/bus/usb dev/bus/usb none bind,optional,create=dir 0 0
  ```
- **NoBackendError (libusb)**: The installer installs `libusb-1.0-0` automatically. If you see this error, run `apt-get install libusb-1.0-0` inside the container




## Uninstallation

```bash
sudo ./manage.sh
```

This script will:
- Stop and disable the systemd service
- Remove the installation directory
- Optionally remove configuration, logs, and user data
- Optionally remove the service user account

The script will prompt you for each optional removal step.


## Docker

You can now run PyMC Repeater from within a [Docker Container](https://www.docker.com/). Checkout the example [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) file before you get started.

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```

Just note that you will have to pass in a `config.yaml` into the container. You can create a new config by following the instructions in the [Configuration section](#configuration).


## Roadmap / Planned Features

- [ ] **Public Map Integration** - Submit repeater location and details to public map for discovery
- [ ] **Remote Administration over LoRa** - Manage repeater configuration remotely via LoRa mesh
- [ ] **Trace Request Handling** - Respond to trace/diagnostic requests from mesh network

Pre-commit hooks will automatically:
- Format code with Black
- Sort imports with isort
- Lint with flake8
- Fix trailing whitespace and other file issues
