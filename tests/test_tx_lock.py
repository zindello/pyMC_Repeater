"""
Tests for TX lock serialisation and duty-cycle TOCTOU fix.
Addresses the three concerns raised in PR 190 review:

  1. Concurrent delayed_sends must not interleave send_packet calls.
  2. Duty-cycle TOCTOU must be fixed: the second packet is dropped when the
     first consumes the airtime budget inside the lock.
  3. Local retry must NOT hold _tx_lock during the 1-second backoff sleep —
     other queued packets must be able to transmit during that window.

Run with:
    python -m pytest tests/test_tx_lock.py -v
or:
    python -m unittest tests.test_tx_lock
